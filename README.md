<p><h3>Rollercoaster Creator Deluxe by GoldenMagic</h3>You can create a roller coaster!. To move forward use the up arrow key, to change direction use the left and right arrows, and to change between track types use the buttons on the left side. Touch the blue arrow to the red arrow to finish the coaster and ride it. Two versions are listed here, the large screen version and normal version. The large screen version has more space to build your coaster. Keep in mind that with the large screen version, you will still need to end the track at the red arrow.</p>
<p><h3>Window Washer by _BestScratch</h3>This is a game where you wash a window using a sponge to find a ball. This is a simple game created by me, and is quick and easy to play.</p>
<p><h3>Roller Coaster Creator by _BestScratch</h3>A game where you create a roller coaster... sort of. To create your coaster, drag the dot to where you want to draw a line, and press the space bar. You can create as many lines as you want. When you're done press C, and then you can either ride it with R or get a save code using S. It's not very good, but go ahead and try it out if you want!</p>
<p><h3>Super Mario Maker 3 by BenjaminWins11</h3>This allows you to create Mario courses, play them, save them, and share them. This game is one of the most amazing and comprehensive ones I have ever seen on Scratch, and thus might take a while to load. This game has such a huge amount of controls that I can't remember them all, so you might need to look those up. One thing that I do know is that you can press Q to switch between erasing and placing blocks.</p>
<p><h3>Paper Minecraft by Griffpatch</h3>This is a very well-known project. It allows you to play a two-dimensional remake of Minecraft. All of the instructions are in the project.</p>
