# READ THIS FIRST!!!
# Most of these projects are NOT mine! I am not claiming to own these projects, I just turned them into HTML files through TurboWarp :/
</p>This repository contains a collection of great Scratch projects that I turned into HTML files. If you'd like, you can go ahead and download the full package right now, but I suggest that you read through the descriptions here to choose which ones to download. Each file's tab icon and title will be that of Google.</p>
<h1>Project List</h1>
<p><h3>Rollercoaster Creator Deluxe by GoldenMagic,</h3> in which you can create a roller coaster. To move forward use the up arrow key, to change direction use the left and right arrows, and to change between track types use the buttons on the side. Touch the blue arrow to the red arrow to finish the coaster and ride it. Two versions are listed here, the large screen version and normal version. The large screen version has more space to build your coaster. Keep in mind that with the large screen version, you will still need to end the track at the red arrow.</p>
<p><h3>Window Washer,</h3>in which you wash a window using a sponge to find a ball. This is a simple game created by me, and is great if you don't have much time to do things.</p>
