# READ THIS FIRST!!!
# Most of these projects are NOT mine! I am not claiming to own these projects, I just turned them into HTML files through TurboWarp :/
</p>This repository contains a collection of great Scratch projects that I turned into HTML files. If you'd like, you can go ahead and download the full package right now, but I suggest that you read through the descriptions here to choose which ones to download.</p>
<p><i>Certain projects will have a folder instead of an individual file. If you click on the folder there will be a description of each file in it.</i></p>
