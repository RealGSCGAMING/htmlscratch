# READ THIS FIRST!!!
# Most of these projects are NOT mine! I am not claiming to own these projects, I just turned them into HTML files through TurboWarp :/
</p>This repository contains a collection of great Scratch projects that I turned into HTML files. If you'd like, you can go ahead and download the full package right now, but I suggest that you read through the descriptions here to choose which ones to download. Each file's tab icon and title will be that of Google.</p>
<p><i>Certain projects will have a folder instead of an individual file. If you click on the folder there will be a description of each file in it.</i></p>
<h1>Project List</h1>
<p><h3>Rollercoaster Creator Deluxe by GoldenMagic</h3>is a game where you choose a type of rollercoaster and then can create a roller coaster in that style. To move forward use the up arrow key, to change direction use the left and right arrows, and to change between track types use the buttons on the side.
